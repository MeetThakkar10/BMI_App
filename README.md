# BMI Calculator

## üìã Project Description
The **BMI Calculator** is an intuitive, easy-to-use web tool that helps individuals assess their health by calculating their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on their height and weight. BMI is a widely used indicator to gauge whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.  

With this tool, users can input their height (in either **cm** or **feet**) and weight (in **kg** or **pounds**), and instantly get their BMI value along with a classification of their health status. This tool is ideal for anyone looking to get a quick, reliable insight into their body composition and make informed decisions about their health.

The **BMI Calculator** provides a seamless experience with a clean and responsive interface, making it accessible across devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
